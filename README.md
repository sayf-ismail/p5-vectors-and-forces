# p5-vectors-and-forces

As an introduction to the Javascript extension p5.js, I tried out this course by D. Shiffman that introduces students to creating visuals.

####Project Link
The project can be found here: https://sayf-ismail.github.io/p5-vectors-and-forces/

####How to run it
1) Using your mouse, **left-click** on the grey area to add a particle that will bounce.
2) Hit **spacebar** to remove the earliest particles.
3) **Hold down mouse left-click** to create a wind force that will blow particles to the right.
